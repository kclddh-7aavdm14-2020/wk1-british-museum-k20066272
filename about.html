                    Hi there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is Jia Luo from Hangzhou, China, and you can call me Jane.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied Interior Design and Applied Linguistics and Language — so I can speak Japanese too — in my previous university.

                    Visiting European architectures, like churches and town buildings, could be a dream for every Design student, and I always thought that only when I got to Europe in person, I could feel the elegant structure and sacred atmosphere. However, the fire at Notre Dame made me rethink. If I’m too late to see something, what can people do to preserve those precious relics? If someone doesn’t have chance to do or to see something, what can I do for them? As internet technology matures, I want to find methods for these issues and see if I could get involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course I will arrive in London in later October to see those splendid architectures. And looking forward to starting this course!
                </p>
