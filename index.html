        <p>Before I take a look at the British Museum website, I had a rough guess of what I might see in this online museum: sections of different themes, exhibits classified by centuries or countries, much more detailed introduction than real museum and even related links, pictures and models can be enlarged and revolved for viewers to look into details, etc.. Honestly, after exploring this website, I found that it was similar to what I had imagined but also different.</p>
        <p>In my perspective, the most significant difference between exploring an online museum and visiting the museum in person is the experience. As for me, the museum building itself, the atmosphere created by lights and visitors, the position in which exhibits are displayed, the movement routes for visiting and other elements contribute to the unique experience of visiting a museum. Obviously, although British Museum website can also provide information about cultural relics and various online exhibitions, it is still not fully immersive to enjoy the museum on a 2D computer screen. This is also why I think VR museums may have more potential.</p>
        <p>In this online museum the section that I am most interested in is the 3D models exhibition, although it took me a lot of time to load 3D Models abroad. The good thing is that I could look at a model from every angle, which might not be that easy in a real museum; however, I could still tell that the model is generated by a computer at a glance, which made me wonder if it was a real artifact. Moreover, it was difficult for me to grasp the actual size of a cultural relic through the photos and models on the screen.</p>
        <p>To human history, digitization is a new way of recording that breaks the physical limits, and I think online museum is very meaningful. But there is still room for improvements in order to provide better visiting experience for viewers.</p>
